"""Checkpoint save/load/cleanup helpers shared by the BlackJAX SMC and nested-sampling backends.

The four BlackJAX SMC mode samplers, ``BlackJAXNSSSampler``, and
``BlackJAXNSAWSampler`` each run their own JAX while-loop and periodically checkpoint it to
``config.checkpoint_dir/checkpoint.pkl``. The load/save/cleanup mechanics
(compute the path, try to resume, fall back to a fresh state on a corrupt or
foreign checkpoint, gate saves on the configured interval, clean up on
completion) are identical across the three; only the state shape, the extra
per-run bookkeeping (SMC's acceptance/covariance histories vs. NS's ``dead``
point list), and a couple of backend-specific hooks differ. This module holds
that shared mechanics; each sampler supplies the differences via callbacks.
