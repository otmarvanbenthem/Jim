Jim is a JAX-based toolkit for Bayesian parameter estimation of gravitational-wave sources.
It pairs differentiable waveform models from [ripple](https://github.com/GW-JAX-Team/ripple) with GPU-accelerated JAX-based samplers, enabling massively parallel inference.

**Supported samplers:**

- [flowMC](https://github.com/GW-JAX-Team/flowMC) — normalizing-flow-enhanced MCMC with optional parallel tempering.
- [BlackJAX NS AW](https://github.com/mrosep/blackjax_ns_gw) — nested sampling described in [Prathaban et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04336).
- [BlackJAX NSS](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) — nested slice sampling described in [Yallup et al. 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24949).
- [BlackJAX SwiG](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) — nested slice sampling with waveform-cache reuse across parameter blocks described in [Yallup et al. 2026](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.28265).
- [BlackJAX SMC](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax) — sequential Monte Carlo with optional adaptive tempering and persistent sampling.

For a quick introduction, see the [Quick Start guide](https://gw-jax-team.github.io/Jim/stable/quickstart/).

> [!WARNING]
> Jim has not yet reached v1.0.0 and the API may change.
> Use at your own risk.
> Consider pinning to a specific version if you need API stability.

## Installation

The simplest way to install Jim is through pip:

```bash
pip install JimGW
```

This will install the latest stable release and its dependencies.
Jim is built on [JAX](https://github.com/jax-ml/jax).
By default, this installs the CPU version of JAX.
If you have an NVIDIA GPU, install the CUDA-enabled version:

```bash
pip install JimGW[cuda]
```

If you want to install the latest version of Jim, you can clone this repo and install it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GW-JAX-Team/Jim.git
cd Jim
pip install -e .
```

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage your Python environment.
After cloning the repository, run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.

## Origins

Jim was originally developed as [kazewong/jim](https://github.com/kazewong/jim) by [Kaze W. K. Wong](https://github.com/kazewong) and others.
The original repository is no longer actively maintained; this fork is the active continuation of the project.
